The goal of this project is to provide a [force-directed graph drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) framework for Rust, as well as 2D and 3D visualizers/renderers that work on the web and desktop. It's built on top of the popular [`petgraph`](https://crates.io/crates/petgraph) Rust library for interaction with already existing datasets in Rust.

**In the simplest terms**, the crates in this project allow you to take a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) and turn it into a pretty picture.

## Stability Note/Future Plans:

 > **Note**: There are some parts of this library that are certainly not as polished as I'd like them to be. My Rust API (and calculus) abilities have improved quite a bit since I first wrote this library, and there is a lot of room for improvement.
 > 
 > While the library is certainly usable, there are a few things that I'd like to address in an upcoming 1.0+:
 >
 > - [ ] Lack of "state of the art" (post 1996) force algorithms such as [ForceAtlas2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679).
 > - [ ] Only simple Euler method instead of more stable [RK4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) or [Leapfrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration) integration.
 > - [ ] Unnecessary `Clone` requirement for `Node` data (and associated "hot-clones" ðŸ˜¬).
 > - [ ] Opaque `Force` *struct* containing a function pointer instead of an idiomatic `Force` *trait*.
 > - [ ] Buggy node dragging in fdg-macroquad.
 > - [ ] Awkwardly worded documentation.
 > - [ ] Unpolished WASM API.
 > - [ ] Sometimes buggy/inflexible DOT/GML/jsongraph parsers.
 > - [ ] [Broken self-connected nodes](https://github.com/grantshandy/fdg/issues/10).
