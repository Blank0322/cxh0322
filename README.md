# fdg
A Force-Directed Graph Library for Rust.


## Dev Branch
This is the dev branch, here I'm working towards a much more polished v1.0. It'll be much more cut back and only one crate (fdg-sim).
 - fdg-macroquad and fdg-img will be 1-file examples.
 - The DOT, GML & jsongraph parsers will be removed and delegated to the user/other's libraries.

 This new version will focus more on idiomatic & generic API design, and performance.
